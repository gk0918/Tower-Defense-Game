# Tower-Defense-Game

🏰 TOWER DEFENCE GAME:

Tower Defense Game is a 2D strategy game built using Python and Pygame.
The player places defensive towers along a path to stop waves of enemies from reaching the base. This project demonstrates game logic, path movement, enemy waves, tower attacks, scoring, and resource management in a clear and easy-to-understand way.

🎮 GAME OVERVIEW:

Enemies follow a fixed path toward your base.
You place towers at strategic positions to stop them.
Towers automatically detect and shoot enemies in range.
Each enemy destroyed gives you points/money.
Use resources wisely to upgrade or place more towers.
Game difficulty increases with each wave.

✨ KEY FEATURES:

Grid/path-based map layout.
Multiple enemy waves with increasing difficulty.
Tower placement and upgrade system.
Automatic enemy detection and shooting.
Health system for the base.
Score and money management.
Game Over and restart option.

🛠️ TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Python 3.
Pygame.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS).

▶️ HOW TO RUN THE GAME:

Step 1: Install Python
Ensure Python 3 is installed.

Step 2: Install Pygame
Open terminal / command prompt and run:
pip install pygame

Step 3: Run the Game
python main.py
Clean multi-file OOP structure.

🎯 CONTROLS:
